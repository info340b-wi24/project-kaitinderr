        </header>
        <p>The users of the web application that we plan on developing will be music fans, specifically those interested in K-pop. Here are the main features we will implement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One of our significant features will be the ranking feature + leaderboard page (as these are dependent on each other). Users will be able to rank songs on a scale of 1-10 based on how much they enjoy them, and we will additionally provide a leaderboard displaying scores so users can see the highest-rated songs. Also, users will be able to search for specific songs for easy access. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Our second significant feature will be a game feature. We will provide the users with details about a song, and they have five chances to guess the song. The details (or hints) we provide include the artist, release date, subgenre, and album. After the user has correctly guessed or used all of their guesses, we will provide a performance overview. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Our final feature will be the recommendation feature. With this feature, users can link two songs and provide input on why if you like one of the songs, you will like the other. Recommendations will be visible next to the song's spot on the rankings page. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users will primarily be viewing information on K-pop songs. We intend to get the necessary data from <a href="https://github.com/EX3exp/Kpop-lyric-datasets">this data repository.</a> In regards to how the app will help to solve our problem, our website will be able to act as a hub for K-pop lovers, as they will be able to discover new music and rank songs they have already listened to (which will let others know how good a song is). This addresses our issue of K-pop enjoyers struggling to quickly find new, good songs as well as not having a place to bond with others over their shared interest in the genre.</p>
        <p>Our project idea was partially inspired by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/"></a>MyAnimeList.</p>
